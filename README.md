# Console-Finances

## Description

This application uses JavaScript to run a report on financial data in an array. It runs a report that determines the total months, net profits, average change in profits, largest increase in profits, and greatest decrease in profits in a given data set over the financial period.

In the case of the greatest increase/decrease of profits, the application also identifies the date at which this occured.
